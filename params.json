Firstly, resource are shared in an easy and accessible way.  Secondly, shared  resources are refined based on requests.  For example, a character might be modeled with a basic rig/skeleton included but a request to have the character updated to include the 2001, Squetch Rig or another rig provided may be submitted.  Every detail of the model and rig can then be refined until the issue at hand is resolved and the request closed.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributorâ€™s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFor specific issues with GitHub see Github [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact).  For help with this repository please open an Issue and describe your issue.\r\n\r\n",
